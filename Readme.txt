SWAG API - Unity Example
========================

This example shows how to use the SWAG API with Unity.

Make sure you Add a SwagObj to your scene, as this is called by the Javascript back into the game. Make sure the name is correct and it has teh Swag API Script attached.

In SwagAPI you will see a lot of calls which can be made to the API.

Use the SWAG WegbGL Template, or you will need to edit your html to include the script files, and also a DIV element to allow the SWAG Popups to appear.

The Show Branding call should happen automatically, using the HTML5 Template.
